	"description": "V 2.9.3. The dbNSFP is an integrated database of functional annotations from multiple sources for the comprehensive collection of human non-synonymous SNPs (NSs). Its current version includes a total of 87,361,054 NSs. It compiles prediction scores from 14 prediction algorithms (SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT, MutationTaster, MutationAssessor,FATHMM, MetaSVM, MetaLR, CADD, VEST, PROVEAN, M-CAP, Eigenï¼Œ Eigen PC), eight conservation scores (phyloP46way_primate, phyloP46way_placental, phyloP100way_vertebrate, phastCons46way_primate, phastCons46way_placental, phastCons100way_veterbrate, GERP++and SiPhy) and other function annotations. We included all the original annotations except for allele frequencies in 1000 genome and ExAC since these are covered in other annotations. 	Note 1: Missing data is designated as '.'. Note 2: The three Uniprot entries are based on Polyphen-2 v2.2.2 annotations",
