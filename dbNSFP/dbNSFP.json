It compiles prediction scores from 14 prediction algorithms (SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT, MutationTaster, MutationAssessor,FATHMM, MetaSVM, MetaLR, CADD, VEST, PROVEAN, M-CAP, Eigen， Eigen PC), eight conservation scores (phyloP46way_primate, phyloP46way_placental, phyloP100way_vertebrate, phastCons46way_primate, phastCons46way_placental, phastCons100way_veterbrate, GERP++and SiPhy) and other function annotations.\n\nWe included all the original annotations except for allele frequencies in 1000 genome and ExAC since these are covered in other annotations.\n\nNote 1: Missing data is designated as \".\".\nNote 2: The three Uniprot entries are based on Polyphen-2 v2.2.2 annotations",
